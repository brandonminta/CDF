## Contents

- **Discretization and Meshing**: Learn about the discretization techniques used in CFD, including finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. Understand the importance of meshing in accurately representing the geometry and flow domain.

- **Conservation Principles**: Explore the fundamental principles of conservation in fluid dynamics, including mass, momentum, and energy conservation. Learn how these principles are applied in numerical simulations to ensure accuracy and stability.

- **Advection**: Study the advection equation and its numerical solution methods. Understand the challenges associated with advection-dominated flows and how to effectively handle them in CFD simulations.

- **Shocks**: Investigate shock waves and their impact on fluid flow. Learn about shock capturing techniques and numerical methods for accurately resolving shocks in CFD simulations.

- **Introduction to Hydrodynamics**: Gain an introduction to hydrodynamics, which involves the study of fluid motion and its properties. Explore basic concepts such as flow regimes, viscosity, and turbulence.
